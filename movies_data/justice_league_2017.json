critics care dumb comic book movie Justice League undemanding movie undemanding audiences While Justice League improvement DCEU movies served Justice League ultimately stale comic book movie It ve The Avengers doesn While I thought Joss Whedon save Justice League production red flags Whedon Justice League isn good In fact fans unsatisfied Whedon cut petition WB release Snyder Director Cut scored Junkie XL home release hoping cut film solve problems theatrical cut Ultimate Edition Batman Superman supposedly WB banking Justice League hit That spent M film Not Marvel expensive film Age Ultron cost But surprising Justice League underperformed box office publications calling flop Justice League doesn hype The Avengers Marvel spent decade developing cinematic universe WB DC accomplish thing film shows Justice League You Marvel movies received positively I The Avengers groundbreaking innovative In fact I thought pretty boring times satisfying payoff multiple standalone films In Justice League characters introduced quickly supposed familiar comic book characters context DCEU This I afraid Justice League movie production I characters Justice League needed films WB make standalone movie character ve Justice League It didn movie hours mandate forced WB unhappy commercial performance Batman Superman wanted Justice League screenings This makes film feel rushed juggle multiple

Superman Yes Superman alive Is surprising The movie comedic I glad Justice League embracing comic book movie hard I comic book movies tackle dark themes issues Batman Superman Man Steel unaware comic book movie aliens fighting aliens It wanted audiences The Dark Knight I positives positive For cast chemistry team feels forced When Batman recruits The Flash part team fights genocidal aliens The Flash immediately agrees friends At Cyborg Aquaman thought While Ezra Miller damn likeable Ben Affleck looked didn film We ve heard rumours Ben Affleck leaving DCEU didn committed franchise It shame Ben Affleck Batman easily part Batman Superman The movie needed drama scenes characters work differences work team That scenes Batman Wonder Woman scenes film Some action scenes long Gotham harbour action scene ugliest special effects I ve blockbuster This movie cost M Suicide Squad effects doesn unforgivable There obvious green screen effects film cornfield scene scene Aquaman water beginning film fight scene Superman The special effects The Flash running didn good running Superman Speaking Superman moustache removal hideous close shots upper lip movement looked unnatural Even I didn Superman moustache removal impossible notice creepy smile film animated mouth cellphone footage beginning film Reshoots aren bad reshoot scenes shouldn obvious Not unfinished CGI made reshoot scenes obvious abrupt tonal shifts makes movie feel Zack Snyder possessed Joss Whedon jokes awkwardly scenes The Flash superhero reduced comic relief character Many scenes painfully unfunny In fact scenes make laugh The Flash It comedic funny Cyborg personality whatsoever There glimpses scene The Flash Cyborg interact scene explains bit origin character dull I couldn sympathize Given origin I care Ray Fisher performance pretty wooden CGI acting Cyborg narrative device actual character There scene Cyborg shoots missile Superman control explaining I figured Cyborg sidelined prolific character film While The Flash Aquaman lacks character Ezra Miller flamboyant performance demeanour Jason Momoa charisma gave characters bit personality There stupid subplot Superman resurrected suffers memory loss
